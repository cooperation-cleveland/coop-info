# How Co-ops Work

## Videos

Useful videos as an introduction to cooperatives

### Basics

* [How Worker Cooperatives Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbZ8ojEuN5I)
* [Own the Change - Short Documentary about Co-ops - 22 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8G1-SYMatNc)

### SELC Resources

SELC (Sustainable Economies Law Center) is a dearth of resources. Their work tends to focus on California but in many cases their work is covering topis in other states.

* [Think Outside the Box Training Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH1UB9wtCtI&list=PL6qQLv9YMwH28AxsxPbyD9lrooCCNFJYB) - Audio is poor quality but exceptional content!
