# Revolving Loan Funds & Co-operative Capital

RLFs usually are basically membered by cooperatives themselves - for example, NCDF below is invested in by equal exchange.
The idea is to provide below or at market rate lending in the interest of growing the cooperative movement. This also usually comes with very replete technical assistance and support for your co-operative. The co-ops that govern these funds are strictly interested in helpinig co-op members to realize their vision.

They will invest in anything from startups, business expansions, housing cooperatives.
